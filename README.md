# Spring-Boot-API-Testing-Demo-Projects
This repository contains two Spring Boot projects demonstrating basic API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The first project uses @RequestMapping, while the second utilizes more specific annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping. Both can be tested via Postman.
